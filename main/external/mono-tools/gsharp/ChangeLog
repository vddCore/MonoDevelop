	* Fix the "Show Gtk" pane feature.   Show an expander with a
	sample.    Perhaps we need some samples here.

2009-09-11  Marek Safar  <marek.safar@gmail.com>

	* Shell.cs: Replaced Report.Stderr with Evaluator.MessageOutput.

2009-09-07  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Shell.cs: Add poor man's autocompletion to GSharp. 

	I probably should copy the way MonoDevelop pops up the completion
	window to be right.

2008-12-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* gtk-gui/Mono.CSharp.Gui.MainWindow.cs: Change hierarchy so that we can
	show/hide the Gtk# panel without crashing.

	* MainWindow.cs: break a Gtk# 2.10 dependency

2008-11-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* MainWindow.cs: Add support for loading settings (window
	position, pane display and aggregate history here as well).

	Hook up View/Pane display here.

	* InteractiveGraphicsBase (PaneContainer): Expose a new property,
	a Gtk.Container that can be used to quickly prototype code by
	having a handy container in the same space as the shell.

2008-11-05  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	Add support for loading files specified on the command line.
	
	* Shell.cs: History saving and loading.

	* Shell.cs: Hook up the GuiStream, which redirects Console Stdout
	and Stderr to the GUI Shell.

	touchups to improve the output.

2008-11-02  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* InteractiveGraphicsBase.cs (RegisterRenderHandler,
	UnregisterRenderHandler): new methods to allow scripts to register
	their own rendering handlers.

	(Attached): useful property to determine if we are running on an
	attached process or not.

	(MainWindow): pointer to the current main window.
	
	* MainWindow.cs: Add support for loading startup files.

	* Main.cs: Move bitmap rendering here, to split it out from the
	Shell.

	* Shell.c: Now can use any provided hook to render graphics on the
	screen. 

2008-10-31  Sandy Armstrong  <sanfordarmstrong@gmail.com>

	* gsharp.desktop.in: Add .desktop file for gsharp. 
	Name/Comment/GenericName could use some review, and no Icon is set
	yet.

	* Makefile.am: Support for .desktop file.

2008-10-24  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Shell.cs: Added history support. 

2008-10-21  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove gsharp.exe[.mdb] at clean-time. Fix "make 
	distcheck"

2008-10-09  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am (gsharp_sources): added InteractiveGraphicsBase.cs
	and SysDrawing.cs.
	(assemblies): add reference to System.Drawing

	* Shell.cs: Loads System.Drawing and special cases rendering of Bitmaps.

	provides a cute and simple Plot() function for interactive use.

	* SysDrawing.cs: Integration between System.Drawing and Gtk#

        * Makefile.am: fix makefile

2008-09-28  Miguel de Icaza <miguel@novell.com> 

	* History.cs: Remove history, will implement a different system than
	  the bash-like system.  This model does not match.
	* Main.cs: Use a cool trick from Alan McGovern to guess whether the
	  host application had Gtk running or not.

2008-09-28  Miguel de Icaza <miguel@novell.com> 

	* MainWindow.cs: New dialog box, based on Paolo's dialog box.
	* gtk-gui/Mono.CSharp.Gui.MainWindow.cs: Add support for injecting
	  ourselves into a process.

2008-09-28  Miguel de Icaza <miguel@novell.com> 

	Added new files for a GUI Gtk# csharp command line interpreter,
	based on Aaron's BooShell for Banshee and the `csharp' command
	line tool.

	The idea is to turn this into a module that can be attached into
	Gtk# applications.
