.SH DESCRIPTION
mperfmon is a tool that allows you to monitor performance counters
exposed by Mono processes or by the operating system.
With the --report option it can be used on the console, otherwise
a GUI is started. In GUI mode each counter added is monitored at
user-specified time intervals (the default is 1 second) and it is
shown in a graph as it changes over time.
